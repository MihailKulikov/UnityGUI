# UnityGUI
The task seemed pretty easy. Therefore, I took it up rather late, for which I paid. Setting up a docker image for a unity is not a trivial task.
This is Unity project without Docker configuration file. Due to some circumstances(I can tell you about these circumstances at the interview), I did not have time to create an image, but soon I must create.
